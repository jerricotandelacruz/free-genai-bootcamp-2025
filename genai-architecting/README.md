## Requirements
	
### Business Requirements: 
To guide students in learning the Filipino language using AI-Powered Assistance.

### Functional Requirements:
Since the business lacks a physical location and its students are spread across the globe, it aims to leverage cloud services. Consequently, AI Models, App Services, and Data Storage will be on the cloud.

## Risks
One potential issue could be a sudden and substantial increase in the cost of the cloud services.

## Assumptions
We assume that we can utilize cloud services for all the resources the system will require. Additionally, we assume that we can easily change the AI models we intend to use, as we will have an interface for it.

## Remarks on my design and study case architecture:
Since the project is currently in the Planning Phase, the other architectural designs for the study cases are not yet finalized. As the project progresses, I will add more architectural designs for each study case that I have written in my conceptual design.
