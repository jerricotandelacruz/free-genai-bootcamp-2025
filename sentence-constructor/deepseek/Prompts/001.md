**State: Setup**  

**Vocabulary Table**  

| English Word | Filipino Word | Type   |  
| ------------ | ------------- | ------ |  
| morning      | umaga         | noun   |  
| plan         | plano         | noun   |  
| swim         | lumangoy      | verb   |  
| afternoon    | hapon         | noun   |  
| run          | tumakbo       | verb   |  

**Sentence Structure**  
`[Location] [Subject] [Verb], [Location] [Subject] [Verb].`  

**Clues and Considerations**  
- The sentence has two independent clauses connected by "and."  
- Time expressions like "this morning" and "in the afternoon" act as locations in the structure.  
- Use the noun form of "plan" (plano) and pair it with a verb to express intent.  
- Verbs like "swim" and "run" should reflect the future tense indirectly through context.  

**Possible Next Steps**  
1. Ask for clues about location markers (e.g., "sa").  
2. Ask how to connect two clauses in Filipino.  
3. Ask about verb conjugation for future plans.  
4. Request examples of similar sentence structures.  
5. Seek guidance on translating "plan to [verb]."  

Try forming your own sentence using the vocabulary and structure above! ðŸŒŸ

# Remarks
So I tried to separate the examples of assistant outputs and the list of sentence structures to an XML file.
In the Vocabulary table, it was able to respond with the correct tables of vocabulary, but the Sentence Structure provided is incorrect; it should be [Time] [Subject] [Verb], [Time] [Subject] [Verb].
