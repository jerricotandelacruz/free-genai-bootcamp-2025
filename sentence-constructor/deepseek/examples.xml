            - BAD: The beginner sentence is uncessary, should just start showing the vocabulary table
            - BAD: The hints are excessively wordy.
            - BAD: The sentence structure is in the form of a fill-in-the-blank sentence. The correct structure should be something like this: [Location] [Subject] [Verb], [Object] [Verb-past].
