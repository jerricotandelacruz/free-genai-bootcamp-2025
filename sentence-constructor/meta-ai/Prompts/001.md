Student Input: This morning, I plan to go for a swim, and in the afternoon, Iâ€™ll run.

# Response By MetaAI
Here's the Filipino translation:
"Ngayong umaga, balak kong mag-swimming, at sa hapon, tatakbo ako."
Or in a more natural Filipino tone:
"Ngayong umaga, mag-swimming ako, at sa hapon, tatakbo ako."
Let me break it down for you:
"This morning" = "Ngayong umaga"
"I plan to" = "balak kong" (or simply "mag-" for a more natural tone)
"go for a swim" = "mag-swimming"
"and" = "at"
"in the afternoon" = "sa hapon"
"I'll run" = "tatakbo ako"
