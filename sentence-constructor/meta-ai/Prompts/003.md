Student Input: This morning, I plan to go for a swim, and in the afternoon, I’ll run.

# Response By MetaAI
Let's break down the sentence into smaller parts and create a table of vocabulary words to help you translate it into Filipino.
Vocabulary Words

| English Word | Filipino Word |
| ------------ | ------------- |
| morning | umaga |
| plan | plano |
| go | pumunta/punta |
| swim | lumangoy/maglangoy |
| afternoon | hapon |
| run | tumakbo/magtakbo |
| and | at |

Now, let's look at possible sentence structures:

1. Time phrase + verb phrase + activity + connector + time phrase + verb phrase + activity
2. Time phrase + subject + verb phrase + activity + connector + time phrase + subject + verb phrase + activity

Using the vocabulary words and sentence structures, can you try translating the sentence into Filipino?

# Remarks
- The vocabulary table list should not include the word “and.”
- It response with answer, if it is ask.
