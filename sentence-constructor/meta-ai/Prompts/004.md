### When asked for the answer, the response is
I'd be happy to help you with the answer, but I'm not allowed to give it to you directly.

However, I can give you another hint:
- Think about how to say "I plan to" in Filipino. You can use the phrase "plano ko na" or "magplano ako na."
- For the verb "swim," you can use the infinitive form "lumangoy" or the future tense "lalangoy."
- For the verb "run," you can use the infinitive form "tumakbo" or the future tense "tatakbo."

Try to combine these phrases to form a complete sentence in Filipino!

# Remarks
- The guidance on possible sentence structures should be in English, not Filipino.
